                random - choose random replica from set of replicas with minimum number of errors
                nearest_hostname - from set of replicas with minimum number of errors, choose replica
                with minimum number of different symbols between replica's hostname and local hostname
                (Hamming distance).
                in_order - first live replica is chosen in specified order.
                first_or_random - if first replica one has higher number of errors, pick a random one from replicas with minimum number of errors.
